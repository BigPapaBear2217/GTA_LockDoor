# GTA_LockDoor
The most optimized lock door that you can found made for fivem standalone.

## To know :
Now there is an other way of doing this system using NATIVE, since i'm not working anymore on fivem
i really insist to use the new way of doing it. 
here is a good tutorial : 
https://forum.cfx.re/t/guide-lock-doors-like-a-boss-how-to-use-gtas-built-in-door-locking-system/

issue know with my version is that if you run or move to fast in front a closed door you can go through even if it's closed seem because of the radius check so up it if needed.
